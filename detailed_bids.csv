The majority of the project will be constructed via pipe bursting and some portions will require conventional open trench methods for installation.


The proposed improvements from the intersection of Avenue D and 1st Street until the end of the project limits (~1,250 LF) will be bid as an additive alternate.


SPECIAL NOTES: The project is located within Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. Portions of the alignment are along the Sierra Taxiway and former installation remediation sites. The work will include Navy base requirements concerning access, construction, work in proximity to Navy airfields (FAA), traffic control, storage and disposal of construction waste, and environmental coordination. The project is funded in part by the Defense Economic Adjustment Assistance Grant (DEAAG) program and the United States Navy.


Base Access can be obtained through a base pass or by participating in the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) program. A DBIDS pass is required for all prime contractor personnel. There is no cost to obtain DBIDS credentials.
